 Registering A Public Class
 --------------------------

 To register a public window class for your control, you would add your DLL
 to the "LoadOneTime" list.  Your DLL, in turn, would contain an ord1 function
 that would perform the WinRegisterClass call which uses the CS_PUBLIC style.
 Remember, CS_PUBLIC is only valid when used within the shell process.
 Therefore, to make your control public, you will need to perform the
 following steps:
     1) Make a backup copy of your current OS2.INI file.
     2) Add your DLL to the "LoadOneTime" list for SYS_DLLS in the OS2.INI
        file.
     3) Shutdown and reboot.

 We have included a sample application, profile.c, that shows how to
 add your DLL name to the SYS_DLLS "LoadOneTime" list.

 Note:  If CS_PUBLIC is used by any process other than the shell process,
        WinRegisterClass will fail.


 Restrictions
 ------------

 The appname, SYS_DLLS, and the keynames, "Load", "LoadPerProcess", and
 "LoadOneTime" are all case sensitive: you must be aware of the case
 sensitivity as shown in the sample application.  Additionally, there is
 a 255 character limit per each keyname string.  Finally, if you have
 modified the string for the "LoadOneTime" keyname, you must reboot
 for your change to take effect.
